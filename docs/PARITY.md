# How our rendering compares to the chat UIs we studied

Measured against the two shared conversations and the product screenshots we collected. This is a design notebook, not a claim that the plugin is a clone. Status is **evidence-based**: "covered" means a scenario is reproduced by the renderer and guarded by a test, not that it looks identical.

## How parity is measured

No single percentage. Three independent measures:

1. **Scenario coverage** — how many reference scenarios we can reproduce end to end, each with a test or a recorded manual check.
2. **Visual deviation list** — concrete, itemised differences (spacing, typography, panel geometry) with severity.
3. **Interaction coverage** — keyboard, focus, mobile behaviour, local state, failure states.

Reference screenshots and our captures are compared at the same viewport width; goldens in tests are regression baselines only and never proof of fidelity.

## Scenario matrix

| Technical explanation with icon rows, inline code, divider            | Covered | `technical`; light+dark screenshots; axe clean                                    |
| Movie collection with rows, posters, detail panel, gallery, related   | Covered | `films`; browser test opens panel, switches photo, follows related, restores focus |
| Marketplace listing: meta strip, price, highlight badge               | Covered | `listing`; meta + badge nodes, schema tests                                       |
| Local calculator with instant recompute                               | Covered | `calculator`; browser test asserts value and reset                                |
| Reactive configurator: input, switch, tabs, conditional sections      | Covered | `configurator`; browser test                                                      |

| Popover, tooltip, image lightbox                                      | Covered | primitives; 8 browser checks desktop+mobile                                       |

| Same-turn repair: invalid fence returns diagnostics to the model      | Covered | diagnostic card with the exact error plus one guarded automatic request (once per document, twice per session per hour, never while streaming); manual button stays |
| Panel that reflows the conversation column                            | Covered | native right-column tab in Harness; isolated host showed a 647px column, related navigation and axe clean; drawer fallback |
| Citations attached to prose                                           | Partial | sources live in the entity panel, not inline                                      |
| Inline entity chip inside a sentence                                  | Covered | `[[entityId]]` in text resolves a declared entity and opens the same host surface; unknown ids stay text |

## Visual deviations (known, not yet fixed)

| #   | Deviation                                                                                   | Severity |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | Typography follows the host font but uses our own scale and rhythm                          | S2       |
| 2   | Wide tables scroll horizontally on a phone; the demo four-column table now fits             | S3       |
| 3   | Chart omits scatter plots and custom series styling                                         | S3       |
| 4   | Entity panel success geometry was never observed in the reference (anonymous share errored) | Unknown  |

## What we are not measuring

- No claim of pixel parity: we have no access to the reference's fonts, tokens or component internals.
- Automated diffs compare our build to our own goldens; they cannot say "closer to ChatGPT".
- Perceived quality needs a human look at side-by-side captures; that is a review step, not a test.

## Backlog derived from this matrix

Ordered by effect on daily use:

1. The repair loop now closes by itself through the conversation service; the button remains for a manual retry.
2. Inline citations inside prose.
3. Scatter and richer chart options.
4. Math, media nodes, artifacts and maps.
5. Provider-backed entity data with provenance and empty/error states.
